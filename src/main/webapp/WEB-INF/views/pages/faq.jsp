				<dt>What is the Ashton Estates Homeowners Association?</dt>
				<dd>The Ashton Estates Homeowners Association (HOA) is a non-profit organization composed of homeowners in the Ashton Estates community. You automatically become a member
					when you purchase an Aston Estates home or townhome.</dd>

				<dt>What are the Covenants and By-laws of the Ashton Estates HOA?</dt>
				<dd>
					The Declaration of Covenants are the <span style="color: #333333;"><strong>governing documents</strong></span> of our association. This document gives the association its
					power and authority and is recoded against each lot. The owner of each lot is therefore subject to the terms and conditions it contains. It is the guideline that all community
					operations follow.
				</dd>
				<dd>In addition to the Covenants, we have By-laws. While the Covenants bestow the authority of the association, the By-laws detail how that authority is to be
					administered. This document has more specific guidelines regarding the day-to-day operation and management of the association.</dd>
				<dd>Owning a home in an association provides many advantages and benefits, but also comes with some boundaries on individual choices. While some restrictions may seem
					inconvenient, they are necessary to maintain consistency in the community and to help enhance the property values of everyone's homes.</dd>

				<dt>How do I pay my assessments?</dt>
				<dd>
					HOA dues are due the March 1st. For 2016, dues are $850/year. Please contact the <span style="color: #333333;"><strong><a style="color: #333333;"
							title="Treasurer Email" href="mailto:treasurer@ashtonestates.org">Treasurer</a></strong></span> for more information.
				</dd>

				<dt>When is the Annual Meeting?</dt>
				<dd>The annual meeting is usually in November. Once the date has been officially set, it will be posted in the 'Upcoming Meetings' section of the home page. As with
					regular Board meetings, all homeowners are encouraged to attend. We will discuss the previous year's projects, as well as plans for the upcoming year.</dd>

				<dt>How can I get exterior changes to my home approved?</dt>
				<dd>
					Ashton Estates has a Building Committee which handles review of all new construction and exterior renovation requests. Please <a title="Building Commitee Email"
						href="mailto:building@ashtonestates.org"><strong><span style="color: #333333;">click here</span></strong></a> to contact the committee.
				<dt>How can I use the Pavillion?</dt>
				<dd>The Pavillion is a wonderful resource for our community. Any homeowner can reserve the Pavillion for a private function, party or family gathering for no charge. We
					ask that anyone who uses this facility clean it afterwards and leave it in the condition they found it. Please contact John Rodgers to reserve.</dd>

				<dt>What are my responsibilities as a pet owner?</dt>
				<dd>Although we love our pets, it is important to remember that not everyone wants one. Dog and cat owners are responsible to keep their pets from infringing on others'
					enjoyment of the community. Dogs must be on leash at all times within Ashton Estates and it is the responsibility of the pet owner to pick up all solid waste immediately.</dd>

				<dt>How do I contact other homeowners at Aston Estates?</dt>
				<dd>
					Our website is currently a public entity to allow not only homeowners information about our community, but others who are interested in our community and/or might want to
					purchase a home for sale. Given this, our homeowner's contact list is distributed only to current homeowners. The list is automatically created from this websites Registered
					users and it can be downloaded from the <span style="color: #333333;"><strong><a style="color: #333333;" title="Residents Only" href="${residents}">Residents
								Only</a></strong></span> section after successful login to the website.
